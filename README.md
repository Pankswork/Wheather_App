🚀 Part 1 – Project Overview (for Developers)

This project is a Weather App built with Flask + MySQL, containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose.

🔧 Tech Stack

Flask (Python) → Backend for weather queries and history storage.

MySQL 8.0 → Database for storing city weather history.

Docker + Docker Compose → Containerized application and DB.

GitHub Actions → CI/CD pipeline to build & push Docker images to Docker Hub.

⚙️ Workflow

Local Development

Write Flask app with .env for API keys & DB credentials.

Use docker-compose.yml to run Flask + MySQL locally.

Database schema auto-creates via init.sql.

CI/CD

GitHub Actions build pipeline runs on every push to main.

Image is built and pushed to Docker Hub.

Secrets like DOCKERHUB_USERNAME and DOCKERHUB_TOKEN are stored in GitHub Secrets.

.env is not uploaded — each user provides their own.

🖥️ Part 2 – User Guide (How to Run)

# Weather API key from https://www.weatherapi.com/
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>

2. Create a .env file

Copy the example below into a .env file in the root directory:

# API key
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Database settings
DB_HOST=db
DB_USER=app_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password_here
DB_NAME=weather_app


⚠️ Make sure you replace your_api_key_here with your OpenWeather API key.

3. Build and start the containers
docker-compose up --build


The app will be available at 👉 http://localhost:5000

🐳 Managing Containers
Stop and Remove Containers
# Stop a container
docker stop <container_name_or_id>

# Remove a container
docker rm <container_name_or_id>


Example:

docker stop mysql-db
docker rm mysql-db

Force Remove
docker rm -f mysql-db

Reset the Database (fresh start)
# Stop & remove MySQL
docker rm -f mysql-db

# Remove the database volume (⚠️ deletes all data)
docker volume rm pythonapp_db_data

# Rebuild and start again
docker-compose up --build
